# SVM_Vs_Linear_Regression
SVM and Linear Regression model are applied to the same data-set and results are compared

Implement linear regression and SVM model with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities. You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.

**Dependencies**
- os
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

**Model**
- Support Vector Machine(SVM)
- Linear regression

**Dataset**
- ex1data1
The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city (in 10,000s) and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city (in $10,000s). A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
